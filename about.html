ABOUT BRITISH BETTY

<h2>WHO IS BETTY? WHAT IS SHE? </h2>
<div id="text">
My name is Betty. I am British. I am an old lady. I recently retired and decided to learn computer programming for fun.
<br><br>
Also, most programming seems to be done by young men and that means there is almost nothing 'out there' designed by and for
grannies. I guess it is up to us grannies to get up to speed and start making our own IT resources.
<br><br>
My long-term ambition is to be a proper programmer. My short-term ambition is just to have fun. So far, I have really
enjoyed this new hobby. It is all very simple and logical, once you sit down and start typing, and much easier than following
knitting patterns, which I was never any good at.
