      This is a very simple static gallery that uses HTML and CSS to display named images drawn from a folder
      hosted by Github.
      <br><br>
      The next stage is to write a <b>Ruby</b> script to bring random images from a folder hosted on my
      cloud accounts. I want to use other sources for the images because Github only offers 1GB of space for
      the free web hosting service - and I have 100GB of storage on services like <b>Box</b> and <b>Mega</b> which I want to use
      to store media (images, movies, audio, documents etc) for use in this project.
<br><br>
This is the CSS code for the gallery (use <em>div class equals gallery</em> in the HTML):<br><br>
<div id="script">
<blockquote>
  div.gallery {<br>
  	padding: 10px;<br>
      align: middle;<br>
  	  width: auto;<br>
      height: auto;}<br>
<br>
  div.gallery:hover {<br>
      border: 0px;<br>
  }<br>
  <br>
  div.gallery img {<br>
      width: 100px;<br>
      height: 100px;<br>
  }<br>
</blockquote>
</div id="script">
<br>
If you prefer a reactive screen on 'hover' then change the border to something bigger than zero pixels. <br><br>

Added some css styling to the basic website. The layout should now adjust to display on different sized screens (laptop, tablet, phone).
And each post now has its own little 'bubble'.
<br><br>
This is the CSS for the curved bubbles. I rather like the effect. It stops everything looking too square.
Use <em>div id equals box</em> when adding to HTML.<br><br>
<div id="script">
<blockquote>
  #box {width: 90%;<br>
  margin: 20px;<br>
  background-color: #11efef;<br>
  padding: 10px;<br>
  border-radius: 4em 1em 4em 1em / 2em 1em 2em 1em;<br>
  -moz-border-radius: 4em 1em 4em 1em;<br>
  -webkit-border-radius: 1em 4em 1em 4em / 2em 1em 2em 1em;}
</blockquote>
</div id="script">
<br>
Still writing everything manually via <b>Atom</b>.
<br><br>
Next project will be to do some simple interactive scripts.

I recently retired. I am new to programming. I am interested in learning IT skills as a hobby and to keep my mind active. Use it or lose it!
<br><br>
I have Windows, Apple, Android (open source and propriatory), Firefox, Sailfish, and Ubuntu portable devices. <br><br>
I buy second-hand items and play with them. I like taking the
hardware apart and putting it together again - I have always done that with technology, ever since I was a little girl. I think I should have been an engineer. Hands-on is how I learn best. <br><br>
I also like flashing different open source operating systems onto my devices (yes, I have bricked a few)
 but apart from this I only use them to consume content.<br><br>
I prefer to do creative projects that involve a lot of screen-time (e.g. editing photographs or video footage) and/or typing (e.g. writing a report) sitting in a proper office chair, at a desk.
My laptop runs Linux Mint so my long-term ambition it to learn to programme in Linux Mint.
My short-term aim is to find resources to teach myself programming that are open source, free, and can be installed on my Linux Mint laptop.
<br><br>
I looked online for advice about which programming language I should start with. I decided to try teaching myself to use <b>Ruby</b> and work up to using other languages.<br><br>
Today, I made my first attempt to use <b>GitHub</b> to build (using HTML and CSS) and host a simple website. Once I have a basic website, I will try to use Ruby to add features to it.
<br><br>
Github provides a tutorial to get newbies started and it is quite good but it leaves out many essential things. For example, it shows you how to create files but not how to create folders. This omission shows the
beginner's guide was not written by a beginner but by someone who understands Github inside-out and thus has a blind-spot about the basics, assuming knowledge
instead of imparting it. <br><br>
<div id="script">
<blockquote>
If you are wondering, you create folders on Github by typing them into the same box used to create files - for example, to create a folder called <em>colours</em> with a text file inside called
<em>red.txt</em> all you do is type <em>/colours/red.txt</em> and Github will create the folder and file for you. It cannot
create empty folders so create a dummy file and save it to make a folder and then delete the dummy file when no
longer required.

I tried the various <em>WYSIWYG</em> website builders compatible with Linux Mint like <b>Jekyll</b> and could not make any progress with them.<br><br>
I tried <b>Github Pages</b> and drew another blank.<br><br>
I then downloaded and installed the <b>Atom</b> editor for Linux distros and just typed the codes manually and then uploaded them to my Github
repository. And this website is the result.
<br><br>
I suspect that the terminal-driven short-cuts like Jekyll are only useful if you are already quite skilled. They are promoted for newbies but
I find that actually as a total newbie I prefer the simple keyboard bashing process. Maybe the physical effort of
typing code helps me understand the logic and commit the process to memory?<br><br>
