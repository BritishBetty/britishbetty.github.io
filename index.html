      This is a very simple static gallery that uses HTML and CSS to display named images drawn from a folder
      hosted by Github.
      <br><br>
      The next stage is to write a <b>Ruby</b> script to bring random images from a folder hosted on my
      cloud accounts. I want to use other sources for the images because Github only offers 1GB of space for
      the free web hosting service - and I have 100GB of storage on services like <b>Box</b> and <b>Mega</b> which I want to use
      to store media (images, movies, audio, documents etc) for use in this project.

Added some css styling to the basic website. The layout should now adjust to display on different sized screens (laptop, tablet, phone).
And each post now has its own little 'bubble'.
<br><br>
Still writing everything manually via <b>Atom</b>.
<br><br>
Next project will be to do some simple scripts.

I recently retired. I am new to programming. I am interested in learning IT skills as a hobby and to keep my mind active. Use it or lose it!
<br><br>
I have Windows, Apple, Android (open source and propriatory) and Ubuntu portable devices. I like flashing different open source operating systems onto them but apart from this I only use them to consume content.
I prefer to do creative projects that involve a lot of screen-time and/or typing sitting in a proper office chair, at a desk. My laptop runs Linux Mint so my long-term ambition it to learn to programme in Linux Mint.
My short-term aim is to find resources to teach myself programming that are open source, free, and can be installed on my Linux Mint laptop.
<br><br>
I looked online for advice about which programming language I should start with. I decided to try teaching myself to use <b>Ruby</b> and work up to using other languages.<br><br>
Today, I made my first attempt to use <b>GitHub</b> to build (using HTML and CSS) and host a simple website. Once I have a basic website, I will try to use Ruby to add features to it.
<br><br>
I tried the various <em>WYSIWYG</em> website builders compatible with Linux Mint like <b>Jekyll</b> and could not make any progress with them.<br><br>
I tried <b>Github Pages</b> and drew another blank.<br><br>
I then downloaded and installed the <b>Atom</b> editor for Linux distros and just typed the codes manually and then uploaded them to my GitHub
repository. And this website is the result.
<br><br>
I suspect that the terminal-driven short-cuts like Jekyll are only useful if you are already quite skilled. They are promoted for newbies but
I find that actually as a total newbie I prefer the simple keyboard bashing process. Maybe the physical effort of
typing code helps me understand the logic and commit the process to memory?<br><br>
