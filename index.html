I am new to programming. Today I made my first attempt to use <b>GitHub</b> to build and host a simple website.<br><br>
I tried the various <em>WYSIWYG</em> methods like <b>Jekyll</b> and could not make any progress with them. <br><br>
I tried <b>Github Pages</b> and drew a blank.<br><br>
I then switched to <b>Atom</b> editor and just typed the codes manually and then uploaded them to my standard GitHub
repository. And this is the result.<br><br>
I suspect that the terminal-driven short-cuts are only useful if you are already quite skilled. They are promoted for newbies but
I find that actually as a total newbie I prefer the simple keyboard bashing process. Maybe the physical effort of
typing helps me commit the process to memory?<br><br>
