<h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
<div id="text">
Mathematics typically deals with idealist abstractions. In conventional mathematics, you define terms, and then
attempt to prove relationships between the entities you have defined. In that paradigm two almost always equals two. In other words,
the fundamental building blocks of idealist mathematics are tautologies. When Artificial Intelligence is based on
programming that follows the same tautological logic, an inability to innovate is built-in to the technology. I think that
idealism means there cannot be the sort of human-like AI which we see in sci-fi movies. Idealism dooms machines to be nothing
more than machines. But worse, it dooms humans to be treated like machinery too. Idealist mathematics is not ethical mathematics.
It plays a part (e.g. via algorithms) in political oppression, economic injustice, social divisions, environmental destruction.
<br><br>
I think that idealist mathematics is in denial about human experience, about the phenomenology of being mortal beings, who age,
and die. We have to acknowledge the reality of time, history, change. As someone once said, we cannot enter the same river twice, time's arrow
flies only in one direction. The fantasy of 'virtual reality' or 'time travel' is a psychosis, a prison for the human mind, body and soul, and
not a liberation (as we were promised back when the 'web' was new). I think mathematics has to embrace realism, embrace history, and
start to think of ways to escape tautology in mathematics and oppressive stagnation in culture. We must
agree that two never equals two. And see how making mathematics accountable to consequentiality, morality, and unavoidable difference
is a way to ensure a better future for mathematics, AI, humanity, and all life on earth. We are more limited in some ways (the ways of reality) than idealist mathematics
allows but the limitations are a discipline that could inspire great intellectual achievements.
<br><br>
What would a programming language look like if it were to reject the idealist paradigm, reject tautology, break away from the
methodology that defines terms and imposes rigid relationships between them in imitation of mathematical proofs? I think that so-called
'bugs' in conventional programming might be instances when reality is breaking through the idealist bubble, times when two is not equalling two,
and if we paid due attention to these 'errors' we might find clues about how to develop a novel realism in computing and in mathematics, and greater
accountability in politics and economics.
<br><br>When things 'go wrong' in my programming, I do not feel discouraged but excited because this stuff is the raw data that could transform
our approach to information technology if we can just find a way to see it for what it is without the habitual blinkers of idealism. I think when bugs
occur we should not rush to fix them but we should try to understand them as possible windows into an alterity. I think professional
programmers do not have the luxury of welcoming bugs. Nor do academics. They are driven to quick fixes by shortage of time and a need to achieve 'measurable outcomes'.
I think hobbyist programmers do have the time to linger over bugs and appreciate them. I predict that the real innovations in IT or AI or mathematics
will not come from the universities or the huge software corporations like Google but from hobbyists who 'get' it and understand that their focus should be very different
from the professionals. Hobbyists must be dedicated bug collectors.
